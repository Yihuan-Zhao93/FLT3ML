About FLT3ML: 
For the classification model, we employed 1,189 active inhibitors and 1,412 inactive inhibitors. The dataset at the cellular level (MV4-11, all compounds are FLT3 inhibitors.) for this research was compiled through an extensive literature review and meticulous data collection, resulting in 844 sets of IC50 data for FLT3 inhibitors at the MV4-11 cell level. 
Mmachine learning-based FLT3 classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.958, while an MV4-11 cell activity prediction model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an R2 of 0.846, MAE of 0.368, and RMSE of 0.492.
